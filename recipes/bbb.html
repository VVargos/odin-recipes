    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Browning the butter before making the dough helps give a rich, nutty taste to these simple, easy biscuits. </p>
        <p>What's more, they're super cheap and great with a cup of tea – what's not to like?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>125g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>125g caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>250g self-raising flour</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat, then heat for 3-5 mins until the surface is all foamy; remove from the heat. When the foam subsides, the butter should be a light, mid-brown colour.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for 5 mins, then mix in the sugar. Transfer to a mixing bowl and leave to cool for 10-15 mins until just lukewarm. Add the egg and vanilla extract; mix well. Stir in the flour and a pinch of salt to make a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Roll into walnut-sized balls and arrange on 2 lined baking sheets, leaving room for them to spread. Press gently with a fork; bake for 12-14 mins until golden. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 mins, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
